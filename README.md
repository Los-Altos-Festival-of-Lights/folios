# What is FOLIOS?

FOLIOS stands for Festival Of Lights Interactions Operating System. It's a software platform that integrates control of light, sound and movement in an easy to use interface. 

The end objective of this work is to define and deliver a next generation, integrated, easy-to-use float control system, called FOLIOS, to drive a single custom PCB that controls sound, lights and movement to be used for all Festival of Lights Parade float designs in the future. A secondary objective is to share the resulting float control platform designs publicly on GitHub for other parades to use. 

The project intends to create by the end of the 2021 summer a capstone goal of demonstrating the value of the FOLIOS system in a working "Rock Band" float. The technical challenges of integrating control of light, sound and movement are nontrivial. And the design flexibility made possible by FOLIOS brings a whole new dimension of possibilities to float design. 

Intensive work is broken down into six 2-week sprints over the 12 weeks of the 2021 Summer. Design work can be done remotely. Work likely could extend past the end of summer depending. Expect to spend several hours a week on site at the maintenance yard for actual work on the floats and on scale model prototype.
